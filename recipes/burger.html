    between soft buns together make a burger the most delicious fast food ever.</p>

        <h2 id="h2i">Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul id="Ing">
            
            <li>2 15oz. cans black beans </li>
            <li>¼ red onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic </li>
            <li>¼ bunch fresh cilantro*</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sriracha</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1.5 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="h2i">Steps:</h2>
        <ol id="stepsb">
            <li>Rinse and drain the canned black beans. Add the black beans to a food processor along with the red onion, garlic, cilantro, sriracha, mayonnaise, cumin, soy sauce, and pepper.
                <br> Pulse the ingredients until they are evenly mixed, but still slightly chunky.</li>
            <li>Transfer the black bean mixture to a bowl and add one large egg and 1 cup breadcrumbs. <br> Stir the ingredients together until they're evenly combined. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the black bean mixture into six equal portions, <br>then shape each portion into a patty, about 3.5 inches in diameter, ½-inch thick.</li>
            <li>To cook the black bean burgers, heat 1Tbsp cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add a few of the black bean burgers and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side,<br> or until they are well browned and heated through. Repeat with more oil and the rest of the patties until they're all cooked.</li>
            <li>Place each patty in a bun, add your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</li>
